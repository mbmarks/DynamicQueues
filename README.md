# Dynamic Queues  
## Summary
This project is to show how to implement a Queue data structure without using built in libraries, excluding File and Scanner for input.

## How to Use
To use this project, download and compile the java files. Run the "DynamicQueueTest.class" file after compilation. To modify that hardcoded variables change them in the java files and recompile. N is the size of the array, i.e. the number of queues. QUEUESIZE is the maximum number of nodes allowed in an queue. You can modify the input by changing or ammending the space delimited pairs in the "data.txt" file.
  
### Origin of Project
This project is from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course that I took in Spring of 2018.
